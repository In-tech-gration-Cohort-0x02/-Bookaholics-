**ESLint configuration**

- The ESLint configuration is typically used by development tools and linters during the development process and doesn't need to be included in the actual runtime of your web application.

- To enable ESLint checking in your JavaScript file, you need to include a special comment at the top of the file that points to your ESLint configuration. This comment is called a "shebang" or "directive comment."




**example**

/* eslint-env browser */
/* eslint-disable quotes */

#eslintrc.json

{
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es2022": true
  },
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2022,
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "rules": {
    "indent": ["error", 2],
    "quotes": ["error", "single"],
    "semi": ["error", "always"],
    "no-console": "warn",
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "eqeqeq": "error",
    "no-var": "error"
  }
}


**eslintrc.js**

module.exports = {

  env: {

    browser: true,

    es2022: true,

  },

  extends: "eslint:recommended",

  parserOptions: {

    ecmaVersion: 2022,

    sourceType: "module",

  },

  rules: {

    indent: ["error", 2],

    quotes: ["error", "single"],

    semi: ["error", "always"],

    "no-console": "warn",

    "no-unused-vars": "error",

    eqeqeq: "error",

    "no-var": "error",

  },

};


**export**  
**statement used in Javascript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from one module so that they can be used in other programs (using the ‚Äòimport‚Äô statement).**


**Module exports**
**the instructions that tell JavaScript which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to export from a given file so that other files are allowed to access the exported code.**

**ECMAScript Modules (ESM)**
**specification for using Modules in the Web. It's supported by all modern browsers and the recommended way of writing modular code for the Web.**

If you want to use the import statement in a JavaScript file to import an ESLint configuration that is written as a module, you need to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM).



**When ESLint runs, it looks for configuration files in the following order:**

.eslintrc.js

.eslintrc.cjs

.eslintrc.yaml

.eslintrc.yml

.eslintrc.json

If you have both .eslintrc.js and .eslintrc.json in your project, ESLint will prioritize the JavaScript configuration.


**env:**

Specifies the environments in which your code is intended to run.
configured for 
- a browser environment  
- ECMAScript 2022 (es2022).

**extends:**

Uses the "eslint:recommended" configuration as a base. This includes a set of recommended rules by ESLint.

**parserOptions:**

Configures options for the parser. It sets the ECMAScript version to 2022 and specifies the source type as "module," indicating the use of ECMAScript modules.

**rules:**

Defines specific ESLint rules and their configurations:

- indent 
Requires 2 spaces for indentation.

- quotes: 
Requires the use of single quotes for strings.

- semi: 
Requires semicolons at the end of statements.

- no-console: 
Warns (instead of errors) when the console statement is used.

- no-unused-vars: 
Throws an error for unused variables.

- eqeqeq: 
Requires strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==).

- no-var: 
Enforces the use of let or const instead of var.
